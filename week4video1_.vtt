1
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:16.139
Michael Franz: Hi everybody. So we are moving our way into week for as we move through the, the rest of the identity crisis book and

2
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:24.930
Michael Franz: I am choosing to do something a little different with lecture one and lecture to this week, which is to say

3
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.880
Michael Franz: I'm going to focus most of my comments and lecture one and lecture two on stuff that's in chapter eight. I know we're going to be talking

4
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:43.440
Michael Franz: In our first discussion section next week about chapter seven. And there's a lot of interesting things in chapter seven that show up. Also in chapter eight.

5
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:52.560
Michael Franz: In terms of major themes. And so some of what is in these lectures will be relevant to the conversation. But what we've been doing with

6
00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.780
Michael Franz: The, the first couple of discussions about the book is sort of talking about what we think is, is really interesting in these chapters.

7
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.380
Michael Franz: And so when we talk about chapter seven. This week I want to hear what you think about the the analysis that they put

8
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:17.490
Michael Franz: In that chapter, and then Chapter eight is much longer. And so we may start some of that conversation in our first discussion, even if you haven't read that chapter. By the time we talked about it.

9
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:27.900
Michael Franz: Based on the way the conversation goes at the beginning of the week. So, but I'm talking about two things that I think really interesting to me in these two lectures this week.

10
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:36.060
Michael Franz: And I have some data that I want to show you in some analysis that I've done that I think are are reflective of the of the work that they did in this book.

11
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:46.710
Michael Franz: And that's around two major issues that I find really interesting. The first is forecasting election outcomes and the second is political advertising. So this lecture.

12
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.010
Michael Franz: This first lecture for the week is about forecasting election outcomes and the second chat, the second lecture.

13
00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:03.570
Michael Franz: Will be about political advertising and I want to talk about political advertising a little bit also with respect to the 2020 election and what we know so far about 2020

14
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:18.750
Michael Franz: But that's next. So the first is to start with election forecasting. And I want to show you the 538 forecasts that Nate Silver puts out there. And so I have

15
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:28.200
Michael Franz: Linked to us in this class resources page 11 election tracking folder and then many of you may have seen this election tracking folder already

16
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.640
Michael Franz: And I've gone here and dug around on some of these cool websites that we'll talk some more about and then see some more frequently.

17
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:44.400
Michael Franz: Throughout the rest of through the semester. And down here is the 538 election forecasts. I've already opened that page. So I'm just going to go up here and open it over here.

18
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:58.020
Michael Franz: And I'm going to go back to the presidential race and the Nate Silver, it puts together for his viewers and readers a forecast of the election outcome.

19
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.870
Michael Franz: Based off of a number of very complicated factors. I'll talk about those in just a second and

20
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:14.040
Michael Franz: It is much more complicated into in detail than what I'm going to show you and what's in the beginning part of chapter eight in identity crisis, but there's a bit of a sort of

21
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:22.620
Michael Franz: Battle that often happens between political scientists who do forecasting models. And then these much more complicated.

22
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:37.890
Michael Franz: State level forecasting models about you know whether or not all the work that Nate Silver did in order to create these different maps and different outcomes. It gets you much more than a very, very straightforward, simple model.

23
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:46.200
Michael Franz: And Nate Silver thinks, obviously the the hard work of doing these simulated outcomes across the states is worth the effort. I actually agree.

24
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:59.460
Michael Franz: Especially when you look at 2020 which is really, really, really messed up in terms of what the fundamentals and the forecasting models suggest, and I'll show you. I'll show you how how messed up. It really, really is.

25
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:17.970
Michael Franz: But first, Nate Silver does a very complicated approach to forecasting the election outcome. And the idea is basically given what we know today, given the state of the election, given the what he calls various fundamentals in the campaign, the economics in a state.

26
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:29.970
Michael Franz: Economics of varying types. The poll numbers in the state where are things right now and it's not necessarily if the election were held today.

27
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:41.610
Michael Franz: What would the outcome be because he waits his forecasts based off of whether how far out from the election. We are the closer we get to the election.

28
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.700
Michael Franz: The polls matter more in his statistical calculations and the fundamentals matter less

29
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:57.930
Michael Franz: farther out the polls matter less and the fundamentals matter more. And so right now we're at a point in the campaign where the polls are starting to matter more and the fundamentals are starting to matter less

30
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.540
Michael Franz: And so it's not really a sort of what he used to call it now cast if the election were held today. It's really

31
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:13.860
Michael Franz: Given what we know what will happen on Election Day balancing out the polls farther out the polls are more volatile closer to election day, the polls are more predictive

32
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:34.350
Michael Franz: And so forth. So it's really a forward thinking forecast, not a now cast because it will it will change how it balances economic factors and polling numbers as we get closer to the election, but the outcome, the outcome of his of his modeling strategy is

33
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:45.510
Michael Franz: A number of sort of simulations based off of uncertainty in the model estimates producing for us to, you know, if you will, a probability that Biden will win.

34
00:05:46.320 --> 00:06:00.210
Michael Franz: And so that comes from simulating the election as he says 40,000 times because the effect of it. The economics on election outcomes. The effect of polls election outcomes is not deterministic. It's, it's, it's probabilistic is the effect

35
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:10.140
Michael Franz: Is strong or weak, but it can vary it can get stronger or weaker depending on various factors. And so the influence of the economy on the outcome of an election.

36
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:19.080
Michael Franz: Has a range of possible effects. And so the simulations take into account those range of possible effects and produce a distribution of outcomes.

37
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:36.630
Michael Franz: That they just simply count up the number of times and their simulations Biden wins and the number of times. Trump wins. And that gets us to their forecast today, right now, which is that Biden will win with a rough probability of about a 77% chance of saying that he will win.

38
00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:42.300
Michael Franz: Now the interesting thing about forecast is is it's sort of like weather forecasts.

39
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.720
Michael Franz: He can't be wrong in the reason why he can't be wrong is because if Trump wins.

40
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:59.730
Michael Franz: There was a 23% chance in in their model on September 17 that that Trump or September 18 that that Trump would

41
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:07.320
Michael Franz: Trump would win. And so it wasn't a zero percent chance. It was a non zero percent chance to sort of like a weather forecast if it's

42
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:14.640
Michael Franz: There's a 30% chance that it will rain. That's, that's not saying it won't rain and so if it rains the forecast isn't wrong. Right. And so the

43
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:26.130
Michael Franz: These forecasting models are never wrong because there's always a chance that one or the other candidates could win. Now, they could be better modeled but

44
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:36.120
Michael Franz: And there might be a lot of uncertainty in these estimates, but but if Trump were to win. Nate Silver will not say his model was wrong, it will say that

45
00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:47.370
Michael Franz: It picked up the, the non zero probability that Trump would win and Trump won and they predicted that in one of four elections Trump will win so

46
00:07:48.060 --> 00:08:02.340
Michael Franz: We happen to get one of those, let's say. So, you know, that's an interesting aspect of forecasting models, but where we are right now suggests that Biden has a really good chance of winning. If you scroll all the way to the bottom here.

47
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:13.080
Michael Franz: Of the the this page you'll see they have a link to their, their methodology. A, you can definitely read this, if you like.

48
00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:28.380
Michael Franz: The methodological pieces that go into these statistical analyses and I'll confess to you that I've read this but I haven't dug down deep into all of the various component pieces into the methodology.

49
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:44.310
Michael Franz: But he's pretty straightforward about how they changed the model from from 2016 and then the approach that they take, you know, step one, collect in LA look at a lot of polling data and he goes through this quite a bit.

50
00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:49.380
Michael Franz: They collect polls they combine the polls with fundamentals.

51
00:08:50.130 --> 00:09:00.960
Michael Franz: Such as demographic and economic data. And interestingly, importantly, to Silver's forecast. It's a state. It's a state level forecast. So he forecast the outcome in Arizona.

52
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:08.610
Michael Franz: In Michigan in Florida, and then they combine all of those to give us the national outcome predicting that Biden will win 77

53
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:25.620
Michael Franz: With a probability of about 77.77 or 70 70% chance when they combine all the state level polls and fundamentals to create outcomes across the states and then in step three of their modeling approach.

54
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:27.840
Michael Franz: They

55
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.840
Michael Franz: Come back that in a second. The account for uncertainty in the estimates, as I mentioned,

56
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:47.040
Michael Franz: Knowing that the effect of any variable could be a little bigger, a little bit smaller. They don't know the true effect. And so they simulate it within that range. The estimated range of possible effects and and get a range of outcomes.

57
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:58.620
Michael Franz: But one thing he points out is, is the closer, as I mentioned, the closer you get to election day, the more their model relies on poles. And so we're somewhere in between.

58
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:13.530
Michael Franz: 25 and 50 around 40 days out. And so you can see here that polls take up a huge percentage of their, their modeling strategy but 84% of their estimates coming from what the polls say

59
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:25.500
Michael Franz: Just a few months ago, it was a little bit smaller. And then, a long time ago. It was a little bit. Well, I guess some in back in April, it was

60
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:39.630
Michael Franz: A lot smaller. And the fundamentals mattered more and so polls become very predictive, the closer you are to election day. And that's why the polls make so much of such as such a big effect on their on their estimation

61
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:50.640
Michael Franz: Interestingly, if you go back here and you look at their forecasts, you can see that these are all simulated possible outcomes with different outcomes in the different states.

62
00:10:51.330 --> 00:11:10.050
Michael Franz: He has here, down here, some interesting graphics and this is the chance of winning. This is the predicted pop electoral college outcomes Biden predicted to win about 330 and you see the change over time. And then the popular vote is

63
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:19.350
Michael Franz: Which I'm going to talk about just a second, with, with a more simple model predicts by them to get about 53% of the vote.

64
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:27.420
Michael Franz: And you can see that there's there's a range here and there's a blue shaded range. It could be as low as 50% as high as

65
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:41.580
Michael Franz: 57% and Trump support could be as high as 50% and as low as 42% given the shading. So you can see the predictions are based off of electoral votes popular votes and so forth.

66
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:49.860
Michael Franz: Now, he also analysis that they've come up with their senate forecast. And so if you click through that you'll get the senate forecast.

67
00:11:50.310 --> 00:12:02.220
Michael Franz: And the points out the democrats are slightly favored to win the senate based off of their modeling, and again, those models are based off of state level estimate state level forecasts of outcomes and

68
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:08.370
Michael Franz: And then aggregating all that up to give us a sense of, of what will happen.

69
00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:19.830
Michael Franz: In the final tally of Democratic and Republican senators. They have forecasts for each Senate race. So if you've been assigned to Senate race, you could look up aware, where your

70
00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:26.640
Michael Franz: Senate race falls in this forecast model and you'll see and I would check it over the course of the

71
00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:33.600
Michael Franz: Rest of the campaign to see where it ends up and how it changes over time. So here, up in Maine.

72
00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:43.800
Michael Franz: They, they say that Sarah Gideon has about a 53% chance of winning susan collins as a 47% chance of winning their forecasted vote share on average.

73
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:57.900
Michael Franz: Is a is a very small win for Gideon and an adjusted a tiny loss for Collins, but you can see that when you simulate around that uncertainty sometimes Collins does better than Gideon, and sometimes getting does better than Collins.

74
00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:03.360
Michael Franz: But about 53 out of 100 times Gideon has more votes than Collins.

75
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:11.610
Michael Franz: And so you get a sense of how will that change over the course of the election as we get more pulls it might not change much. If there aren't many polls.

76
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:22.680
Michael Franz: But it will if we get more polls and those polls show movement towards, towards Collins in Arizona for example where we have a possible democratic pickup. You see that they give

77
00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:35.280
Michael Franz: Mark Kelly about a 78% chance of winning. On average they expect him to get about 50% of the vote and mix it in about 44% of the vote, and there's a third party candidate they predict will get about 6% of the vote.

78
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:49.380
Michael Franz: And so that gives Kelly, the edge and so they do this across, across the the different senate campaigns in Iowa. It's about a 59% chance of winning for Joni Ernst

79
00:13:50.490 --> 00:14:04.950
Michael Franz: She only gets about 50% of the vote to greenfields 48% of the vote, but that 2% edge is enough. And these simulations to say that she's got about a three and five chance of winning the campaign that may change.

80
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:21.390
Michael Franz: As as the campaign's take shape and then push the poll numbers in various directions so forecasting models are really complicated. And we really can't get into the details, but chapter eight and identity crisis.

81
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:32.010
Michael Franz: Talks about a much, much simpler forecasting model a forecasting model that looks not states and then aggregates up but looks just at

82
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:40.770
Michael Franz: The fundamentals in previous presidential elections and compares the fundamentals. In this case, the economic fundamentals, the state of the economy and each year.

83
00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:51.120
Michael Franz: Against the against the outcome and shows that by and large, there's a fairly tight relationship between the outcome of an election and a presidential year and

84
00:14:51.480 --> 00:15:03.420
Michael Franz: The economic conditions in that election year, such that it becomes generally fairly predictive to say, How's the economy doing in the election year, and using that to predict how well the incoming party.

85
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:19.380
Michael Franz: Will do. And in chapter eight. They point out that in 2016 a simple, very simple forecasting model with a data set that has one row for each presidential election since 1948 that's that's 18 elections.

86
00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:24.510
Michael Franz: Predicted that Clinton would win a little more than 50% of the popular vote.

87
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:32.250
Michael Franz: And that's what she did well at least the two party popular vote. She won more votes than Trump, there was some third party candidates, but if you just look at the

88
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:40.950
Michael Franz: The percentage of the vote between Clinton and Trump. She got about 50% 51% of the two party vote. And that's what the model predicted

89
00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:54.120
Michael Franz: So given that, you know, the model predicted in 2016 and close election. And that's what we got. What is the model predict in 2020 and and this is a simple model. And if you read the methodology nate silver's

90
00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:01.650
Michael Franz: Link He hates these symptoms doesn't hate them. But he points out that they're flawed and in many ways.

91
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:15.060
Michael Franz: Well, they're not flawed dramatically flawed, in many ways, but it's really, really problematic and flawed in 2020 and that's what I want to show you. So we'll go back to

92
00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.670
Michael Franz: This and I think I need to

93
00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.780
Michael Franz: Go to our Blackboard page.

94
00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:26.970
Michael Franz: And

95
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:31.710
Michael Franz: I'll go to our module and I've posted these in the week for module.

96
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:36.690
Michael Franz: So you may have seen these already before you watch the lecture I'm going to walk you through them.

97
00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:45.090
Michael Franz: Here is my attempt to replicate figure eight one in the book and it's actually not a

98
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:54.450
Michael Franz: It is not a replication of figure eight one in the book. And the reason why is because if you notice in a figure eight one.

99
00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.720
Michael Franz: On page 158

100
00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:01.320
Michael Franz: Which is right here in

101
00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:15.150
Michael Franz: They put the x axis, the horizontal axis is growth rate and gross domestic product from quarter one to quarter three of the election year quarter, one quarter three of the election year.

102
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.010
Michael Franz: We

103
00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:28.260
Michael Franz: I can do that. And I can replicate figure eight one perfectly well from the book, but we don't have quarter three in in 20 20th quarter three isn't

104
00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:34.110
Michael Franz: isn't available to us yet. And so we just have

105
00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:42.450
Michael Franz: We can shift things back by one quarter. And so I replicated figure eight one, because that's what I'll do, in some of these models below.

106
00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:51.510
Michael Franz: I looked at the relationship between economic growth GDP change in quarter three of the previous year. So in quarter three of say 2015

107
00:17:52.140 --> 00:18:06.300
Michael Franz: Quarter to of 2016 so it just shifts the analysis up by by one or shifts it back by one quarter and looks at economic change in that period of time. And you can see here that when you when you do that.

108
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:20.730
Michael Franz: Just by shifting things by one quarter and looking at elections to 1948 and 2016 you'll see that 2016 Clinton gets a little more than 50% of the two party boat. The Clinton Trump boat.

109
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:34.170
Michael Franz: And she does a little better than what a simple model would predict from GDP growth in Q3 of the previous year to Q2 of of the election year.

110
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:41.640
Michael Franz: The regression line in Figure eight one actually shows 2016 kind of falling right on the line.

111
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:51.120
Michael Franz: But this shows slight difference from that because I'm not looking at the same I'm not looking at the same x axis. I'm looking at different quarters.

112
00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:59.310
Michael Franz: But the general gist of things. If you look at the, you know, it's not going to change all that much quarter to quarter. So just shifts the predictions slightly

113
00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:07.980
Michael Franz: But it would if you did that, you would see that actually Clinton outperformed the fundamentals. So the fundamentals basically

114
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:22.140
Michael Franz: Given everything we know between 1948 and 2016 where what is the relationship and that's estimated with this line, right, there's a lot of variation around the line the points don't fall perfectly on the line.

115
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:41.070
Michael Franz: And so this is just an estimated effect of the relationship between GDP growth and income party vote share popular vote outcomes but it says that Clinton actually did slightly better than, than the model, a simple one variable modeling that would would predict.

116
00:19:42.120 --> 00:20:04.560
Michael Franz: In 2008 you see that McCain, who is the Republican candidate. So the incumbent party in 2008 where the Republicans did worse than what the model would predict GDP was was growing pretty good up until the financial crisis in the fall and then he did

117
00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:13.170
Michael Franz: Worse than than this regression line would would predict. Although it's still predicts that Obama would win that McCain.

118
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:26.490
Michael Franz: would lose. And so you get this kind of, you know, simple model, right. I didn't do a lot of work here on this just grabbed GDP growth presidential outcomes and put a plot together. Nate Silver has been hundreds of manpower hours.

119
00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:41.490
Michael Franz: Person power hours putting together these these these these his website. It's very nimble and very complicated and in here. I am coming in with something that the authors of this book put together as very, very, very straightforward.

120
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:52.890
Michael Franz: But, you know, let's use this sort of generic structure to talk about 2020 because forecasting is so interesting, with respect to

121
00:20:55.080 --> 00:21:14.940
Michael Franz: The underlying question, which is, who's going to win this year. And the reason why 2020 is so messed up is because of the fundamentals are are all over the place. The fundamentals are a mess. Given coven 19. So let me show you. First, the predictions that come from a simple model.

122
00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:26.220
Michael Franz: That uses not GDP growth but per capita disposable income change. So how do we measure the economy. Well, one way to measure the economy is unemployment.

123
00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:32.970
Michael Franz: Another way to measure the economy is the stock market. Another way to measure the economy is changing GDP.

124
00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:40.860
Michael Franz: And another way to measure the economy is how much money to people have right if people have a lot of disposable income things must be going pretty well.

125
00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:49.860
Michael Franz: If people have don't have a lot of disposable income or their income is constricting or getting smaller, or you know they're losing money disposable income.

126
00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:56.460
Michael Franz: Because costs are high or something, then the economy is not doing very well maybe it's asked people

127
00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:06.690
Michael Franz: How they feel the economy is going. Do you feel good about the economy or bad, but the economy and that could be a measure of economic growth. So there's a lot of different ways to measure the economy.

128
00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:19.920
Michael Franz: Well. One common way to do it is to take data on income change and look at it from again either quarter one to quarter three and the election year, or in this case, because we don't have quarter three data yet.

129
00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:27.180
Michael Franz: Quarter three of the previous year to quarter to have the election year. So looking at in the case here, the third quarter of 2019

130
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:35.790
Michael Franz: To the second quarter of 2020. Now what happened between the third quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020 coven blew up right Cove, it happened.

131
00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:40.620
Michael Franz: And because coven happened, the economy got really bad. And this is where the problem lies.

132
00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:59.640
Michael Franz: 2020 over here shows income growth. This is a proportion, you might think of it as a percent, but just multiplying it by 120 20 the difference in income that people had suppose will income per capita, the people had from quarter three of 2019 to quarter to have 2020

133
00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:02.580
Michael Franz: income increased by 10%

134
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:11.730
Michael Franz: income increased by 10% according to economic data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis why right we said the economic

135
00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:21.900
Michael Franz: All economic numbers TANKED IN THE SPRING going into the summer of 2020 but incomes went up. And the reason why incomes went up is because of the stimulus checks.

136
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:32.700
Michael Franz: That everybody got in the spring. Everybody families got thousands of dollars from the government to make up for the loss and income that they were getting from their jobs.

137
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.640
Michael Franz: Well, many people kept their jobs.

138
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:43.140
Michael Franz: And got these checks plus people's expenses went down because they

139
00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:51.300
Michael Franz: Weren't stuck at home, they weren't paying for gas. They weren't paying for car maintenance they, you know, they weren't paying for many things that they

140
00:23:51.510 --> 00:24:07.050
Michael Franz: Are trips vacations. People had money. They weren't paying for airfare and so when the government measured people's disposable income people were sitting on more money than than they had in the end of 2019

141
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.580
Michael Franz: That's a bit of an illusion, because the economy itself is going through a lot of

142
00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:22.320
Michael Franz: Challenges. But in terms of per capita disposable income if if a government gives me thousands of dollars and I can. This happened to me. The government gave me a stimulus check

143
00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:34.680
Michael Franz: And I canceled my family trip to North Conway, New Hampshire, and I got that money back, which was, you know, a couple hundred bucks. I was actually had more money in my bank account than I normally would.

144
00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:42.780
Michael Franz: Even though the economy was not doing so hot. I didn't lose my job. So put that aside for a second. But people were getting

145
00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:54.030
Michael Franz: Unemployment checks, plus an additional $600 in unemployment that was happening at the time, so income actually is artificially high in the Q3 to Q2 analysis.

146
00:24:54.780 --> 00:25:04.650
Michael Franz: That we normally do to make predictions in an election year. So, lo and behold, see income change and presidential performance is

147
00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:14.310
Michael Franz: strongly related or at least the predicted outcome of a two party vote in the presidential race is strongly related to income growth when incomes grow.

148
00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:27.030
Michael Franz: The income and party does really well when incomes constrict or stable or don't grow as much the income and party doesn't doesn't do very well in 1980 democrats were in the White House.

149
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:42.000
Michael Franz: incomes were getting smaller disposable income was going down because inflation was going up. Well, Jimmy Carter and do that very well that here in in 2008 incomes were growing a little bit but

150
00:25:43.170 --> 00:26:00.150
Michael Franz: The Republicans didn't do very well in 1984 when Reagan was running for reelection in comes we're growing economy was booming. He did really, really well. Given that 2020 a simple forecasting model using income change predicts that that Trump would win 60% of the popular vote.

151
00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:15.450
Michael Franz: That's not going to happen. Right. That's not going to happen. He's not going to win 60% of the popular vote, I guarantee it right this model stinks. Because income is so wonky fishier given

152
00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:19.710
Michael Franz: Given the stimulus and given unemployment benefits.

153
00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:30.780
Michael Franz: But if you if you take out 2020 and you try to fit align to these plots, it actually would be pretty steep, it actually look it go through these points over here 2020 is pulling that model.

154
00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:40.770
Michael Franz: down this way because we've never seen income change that big rises twice income change that we saw in 64 and 84 economy was going really well, and both those years.

155
00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:50.610
Michael Franz: Income changes growing twice that rate. And so it's pulling the predictive models down over here, the tight line that would fit over here would show

156
00:26:51.240 --> 00:27:00.180
Michael Franz: Where we would be without 2020. Now I didn't mention this, but my statistical model controls for a couple of factors takes into account the approval rating of the President.

157
00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:15.120
Michael Franz: In the summer and whether the incumbent is running or if it's an open an open seat. And so, it accounts for those things and looks just at the effect of income change and Trump's mostly a 20 60% of the vote that's that's bonkers, that's just that just won't, won't happen.

158
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:20.370
Michael Franz: So what if you did a different model, a different model that showed

159
00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:27.540
Michael Franz: GDP change right so better maybe a different indicator of the economy. Well,

160
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:37.200
Michael Franz: Normally when a cup incomes grow the economy is growing GDP is growing incomes get bigger GDP grows well this year.

161
00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:58.500
Michael Franz: Nope incomes are growing and GDP is getting smaller. In fact, if you look at core three of the previous year to quarter to have this year GDP shrunk by almost 10% quarter over, quarter, quarter so cork Paris and a quarter comparison. It's almost a year to year comparison.

162
00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:07.890
Michael Franz: In the GDP, the size of the economy got much smaller businesses close you know everything shut down. So there wasn't a lot of generating income.

163
00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:12.510
Michael Franz: People had more money because the government was giving them money and people weren't spending money.

164
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:24.300
Michael Franz: But in terms of the money that was being moved around in the economy. It was much, much, much smaller. And so if you use GDP growth from Q3 to Q2.

165
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:33.600
Michael Franz: As a prediction for what will happen in 2020 this model says the Trump will get less than 40% of the popular vote.

166
00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:42.420
Michael Franz: That's not going to happen either he's going to get at least 45% of the popular vote. And so this model is is bonkers.

167
00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:48.750
Michael Franz: As well, because we've never seen GDP, get this, you know, constrict this much.

168
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:57.720
Michael Franz: Smallest it's it's it's constricted in the quarter to quarter comparison is in 1980. And that was, you know, sub zero but but not

169
00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:11.790
Michael Franz: As big as 10%. I mean, these numbers are are really nuts. And so the fundamentals this year are just completely at odds with one another and they predict that Trump will get somewhere between 40 and 60% of the vote, depending on

170
00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:23.070
Michael Franz: What what what indicators, you use. Well, you could have told me that at the very beginning. And so these fundamental forecasting models are are garbage.

171
00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:35.460
Michael Franz: When you think about 2020 right now. Outside of 2020, it seems like a pretty tight relationship, such that the regression line would would go through these points, just like this.

172
00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.150
Michael Franz: And so, you know,

173
00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:57.780
Michael Franz: Wow, now we're not even done yet because a third way of doing this is to to look at consumer sentiment. So instead of saying GDP. Instead of saying income. Let's just ask people how they feel. The economy is going. So typically what

174
00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:03.960
Michael Franz: forecasters do is they look at people's assessment of the economy and change in that assessment.

175
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:10.230
Michael Franz: Between may have election year in August of the election year. So, you know, as we're moving into the fall campaign.

176
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:15.750
Michael Franz: Do people feel the economy is getting better. And if people feel the economy is getting better. They're more likely to reward president

177
00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:22.050
Michael Franz: And the President party if the people feel like the economy is doing worse. They're more likely to punish the president and the President's party.

178
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:30.600
Michael Franz: And so consumer sentiment here is based off of people who say the economy is getting better versus people who see the economy is getting worse and then

179
00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:43.410
Michael Franz: Creating an index that can range in some some values lower numbers mean people say the economy is getting worse higher numbers me mean people on average, say, the economy is getting better.

180
00:30:44.010 --> 00:31:01.770
Michael Franz: So if you look from May to August. Okay. The income measure is based off of 2019 to quarter to have 2020 GDP is based off of the same time period, both of those numbers are at odds with one another because more people have more money, but the economy is getting smaller.

181
00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:12.060
Michael Franz: Consumer Sentiment evaluations are based on May to August of the election year, but it made August to be election year, people started to think the economy was doing better.

182
00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:18.750
Michael Franz: Because was much better than it was in in March and April and unemployment is actually come down a little bit.

183
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:31.740
Michael Franz: In the last number of months. And so, consumer sentiment is not actually in the in the in the basement, nor is it, nor is it through the roof. It's somewhere in the middle. As you can see, and so consumer sentiment predicts

184
00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:54.060
Michael Franz: right in line with the regression line that Trump will get about 51 or 52% of the vote now. This made me laugh because I've got three forecasting models. One predicts 40% of the vote one predicts 50% of the boat one predicts 60% of the vote, I mean, talk about useless and so

185
00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:05.070
Michael Franz: Outside of these forecasting models have some value in 2020 they seem sort of useless, which makes me want to go to Nate Silver site.

186
00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:11.850
Michael Franz: More than it does, you know, believe that these simple models are useful because 2020 is such an anomalous year

187
00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:19.860
Michael Franz: I don't know what to make, how to make sense of it all the economic indicators are all over the map. And so, you know,

188
00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:26.010
Michael Franz: It's, it's amazing. Now we can see that by looking at this final graph which is

189
00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:38.070
Michael Franz: Let's take the first model, which was income growth. Let's take the second model, which was GDP growth. Let's get the predictions from both of those models. And let's look at how closely related. They are

190
00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:46.590
Michael Franz: And you can see here, they're extremely closely related. Okay, this is a regression line that does not include 2020

191
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:55.830
Michael Franz: And you can see in the GDP model. It predicts Trump getting 20% of the vote or 40% of the vote in the income based model. It predicts getting 60% of the vote.

192
00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:04.410
Michael Franz: In every other comparison, the GDP version of the model and the income version of the model produced very similar predictions.

193
00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:13.890
Michael Franz: Very similar predictions are tightly related with one another in 2016 it didn't really matter whether you use GDP or income it predicted a close race.

194
00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:27.930
Michael Franz: In 1956 it didn't really matter where the US GDP or income it predicted an Eisenhower when same thing and 64 Lyndon Johnson with same thing in 2008 and Obama when McCain loss and so

195
00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:32.760
Michael Franz: In general these prediction models work pretty well.

196
00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:45.360
Michael Franz: Not in 2020 and 2020 they're a complete odds with one another and and and it's it's it's remarkable, remarkable to see that. And so now I highlight those

197
00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:54.510
Michael Franz: That here because they talk a lot in this chapter about the fundamentals, the impact of the fundamentals. We hear a lot about predictions and forecasting models.

198
00:33:55.560 --> 00:34:01.110
Michael Franz: And so we should be aware of what all that means. And we should be aware of the the the accuracy of these predictions.

199
00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:11.340
Michael Franz: And so I wanted to focus on that today because I think that's something that we might not get a chance to talk a lot about in these discussion groups.

200
00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:20.970
Michael Franz: Because there's so many interesting survey based data that they they do here looking at the effect of identity and racial characteristics on on people's assessment of the candidates.

201
00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:37.290
Michael Franz: So I'm going to stop there. We excited to talk about your thoughts on on these other chapters and and then I'll do another lecture about the advertising and the campaign coming up next. So thank you so much and have a great day.
